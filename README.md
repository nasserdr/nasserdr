👋 Hi, I’m Hassan-Roland Nasser, PhD — Visual AI Scientist & Ex-Entrepreneur

🔭 I’m a Visual AI Scientist & AI Lead at Agroscope, coordinating computer vision activities across agriculture, livestock, biodiversity, and remote sensing.

🤖 I build large-scale applied AI systems, lead multidisciplinary teams, and design strategies that bring machine vision into real-world deployment.

🚀 I’m also the founder of Pixtell, a consultancy company specializing in Visual AI for agriculture and the environment.
